# FunCppCode

I found fun alternative operators for cpp in this article https://www.cedricmartens.com/articles/alt_ops and decided to write some cursed c++.
C source code must be compatible with the ISO 646 invariant character set. This non-ascii character set was developed as a base for international 7-bit variant character sets. Due to C++ backwards compatibility with C, these alternative operators are also in C++ today.
